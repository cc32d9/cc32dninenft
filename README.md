# cc32dninenft: Blockchain Moments by cc32d9

## NFT sale

The Atomic Assets NFT collection `cc32dninenft` will be a series of
memorable events related to my pseudonym (cc32d9), mostly known in
EOSIO blockchain space. The assets will be issued on WAX and EOS
public blockchains.

The images are made in minimalist, text-only layout (because I'm bad
at graphics).

The goal of this NFT sale is to sponsor a number of software projects
in EOSIO ecosystem. The revenues will be split as follows:

* 25% will be sent to the account `eosiofndnorg` on EOS and WAX which
  is being set up for [EOSIO Foundation](https://eosio.foundation/).

* 25% will be sent to the account `cc32dninedao` on EOS and WAX (see
  below).

* 50% will be used for my own projects from my [pending
  list](https://github.com/cc32d9/cc32d9_ideas_for_EOSIO/blob/master/Needs_Funding.md).



## The DAO

It is planned to build a distributed autonomous organization, using
25% of sales revenue, so that all Blockchain Moments NFT holders can
decide how to spend the money.

Any NFT holder will be able to issue a proposal to sponsor an
open-source development or some other project, and the community of
NFT holders will make a decision, using the following rules:

* The proposer deposits some amount, worth around $50, and the deposit
  is only returned in case of a positive outcome.

* Voting ends in four weeks after the proposal is submitted.

* Voters can vote "YES" or "NO", supporting or objecting the proposal,
  correspondingly. One asset from `cc32dninenft` collection counts as
  one vote.

* The proposal needs to collect at least 15% votes of total amount of
  circulating NFT, and more than half of votes should be YES.

* I don't take part in voting, but I have the right of veto that
  terminates the voting and rejects the proposal.

It's yet to be decided how users on EOS and WAX can take part in the
same ballot, and the DAO smart contract is yet to be written.


## The NFT series

### Series 1: First post in cc32d9 blog

The first series celebrates the moment when I created this
pseudonym. I wanted to start publishing blockchain related articles,
and took a hash from my real name. The first 6 symbols made up the
nickname.

The NFT image uses the `Ac437 Verite 9x16` font from awesome
[Oldschool PC fonts
collection](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/).

The series will contain only 100 items which will be sold on Atomic
Hub auction.
